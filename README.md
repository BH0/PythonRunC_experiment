# PythonRunC_experiment
This Python script will run a Batch script which will compile a C program... Is very much a playground of mine. Please note that I did not create the Batch script. 

Instructions / Setup:
Ensure you have 3 folders: 'src' (which will contain 'toRun.c'), 'bin' (will contain the executable) & 'obj'. 
Everything else may be stored in the 'root'.
You will also need to ensure you have MinGW installed. 

The following files are not made by me:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgmp-10.dll
libiconv-2.dll
libmpc-3.dll
libmpfr-4.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
