# PythonRunC_experiment
This Python script will run a Batch script which will compile a C program... Is very much a playground of mine. Please note that I did not create the Batch script. 

Instructions / Setup:
Ensure you have 3 folders: 'src' (which will contain 'toRun.c'), 'bin' (will contain the executable) & 'obj'. 
Everything else may be stored in the 'root'.
